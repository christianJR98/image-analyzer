# Image analyzer

I made this project to learn C# and implemented graph algorithms

### Algorithms used

- Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)
- Minimum spanning tree: Prim and Kruskal
- Closest pair of points (brute force and divide and conquer)
- Depth first search (DFS) and Breath first search (BFS)
- Shortest path: Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall
